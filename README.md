### Hi, I'm Kevin!

I'm a developer and an undergrad studying Computer Science, interested in machine learning and its applications to bioinformatics, finance, and other fields.

I love technology and learning new things. Currently, I'm exploring software engineering and data science. For the past few years, I've been working with Curoverse Research to help us better understand the human genome.

In the summer of 2019, I worked at Intralinks as an intern on the innovation team, building natural language processing pipelines to help streamline customer acquisition.

I am currently a software engineering intern at Google, on the Business Messages team.
